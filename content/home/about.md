# Welcome to my website!

I am an applied economic theorist working on environmental economics, game theory, and lab experiments. My home base is the Department of Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden. I am also a guest lecturer in the [Central-German Doctoral Program Economics](http://cgde.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/3257-2/) and co-organize the seminar series at my department.

**I am on the 2022-2023 job market and will be available for interviews at the EEA 2022 and the ASSA 2023 meetings.**

In my (non-existent) free time, I play the violin. Colleague [Sjak Smulders](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/sjak-smulders) and I from time to time force upon our fellow economists a [concert](https://twitter.com/TiUEconomics/status/1111204863382380544) in which we play music of our own choosing.

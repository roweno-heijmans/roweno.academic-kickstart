# Biography

Welcome to my website! I am an applied economic theorist working on environmental economics, public economics, game theory, and lab experiments. My home base is the Department of Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Sweden. I am also a guest lecturer in the [Central-German Doctoral Program Economics](http://cgde.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/3257-2/) and co-organize the seminar series at my department.

I am principal investigator and project lead for a **Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius stiftelse** program grant. The project is titled [Trading Emissions to Combat Climate Change: Problem or Promise?](https://www.handelsbanken.se/shb/inet/IStartSv.nsf/FrameSet?OpenView&id=Forskningsstiftelserna) (P22-0229).


In my (non-existent) free time, I play the violin. Colleague [Sjak Smulders](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/sjak-smulders) and I from time to time force upon our fellow economists a [concert](https://twitter.com/TiUEconomics/status/1111204863382380544) in which we play music of our own choosing.

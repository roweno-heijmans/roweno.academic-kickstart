# Welcome to my website!

I do research in environmental economics and game theory.

I also teach mathematics in the [Central-German Doctoral Program Economics](http://cgde.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/3257-2/).

I am  affiliated with the [Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences](https://www.slu.se/en/departments/economics/).

In my (non-existent) free time, I play the violin. Colleague [Sjak Smulders](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/sjak-smulders) and I from time to time force upon our fellow economists a [concert](https://twitter.com/TiUEconomics/status/1111204863382380544) in which we play music of our own choosing.

# Welcome to my website!

I am an applied economic theorist working on environmental economics, game theory, and lab experiments. My home base is the Department of Economics at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. I am also a guest lecturer in the [Central-German Doctoral Program Economics](http://cgde.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/3257-2/) and co-organize the seminar series at my department.

In my (non-existent) free time, I play the violin. Colleague [Sjak Smulders](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/sjak-smulders) and I from time to time force upon our fellow economists a [concert](https://twitter.com/TiUEconomics/status/1111204863382380544) in which we play music of our own choosing.

**Exciting news**: new paper forthcoming in the _Journal of Environmental Economics and Management_. Read the latest (pre-copy-edited) version [here](https://www.roweno.nl/files/interestrate.pdf)!
